# PGxCorpus

PGxCorpus is a manually annotated corpus, designed for the extraction of pharmacogenomic realtions from text. 
It is composed of 993 sentences mannually annotated, issued from 958 distinct PubMed abstracts. 
Annotation has been achieved by 11 annotators, including 5 senior annotators. 
Each sentence has been seen independently by 3 annotators, including one senior.  

PGxCorpus is also available on [FigShare](in preparation).

## Annotation guidelines

The annotation guidelines were provided to the annotators to reduced the heterogeneity in the annotation task.
